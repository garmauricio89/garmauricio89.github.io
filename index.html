<p>Hello - I'm Mauricio, a former sales and marketing specialist turned web developer! I've spent time in the military I recently decided to venture into a new field and learn how to code. I have become very comfortable with html, css, vanilla javascript, jquery, react,  and ruby on both rails and sinatra. I have experience deploying sites on heroku and have linked my github below so you can check out my code! I have also included my resume and a small demo of one of my projects for a well known youtuber below. My main goal in this field is to grow and be able to find a place where that is possible while still contributing to a greater cause. Please feel free to reach out with any questions and I look forward to possibly working with you!</p>

<p>This application was specifically made for a popular youtuber. It uses google maps to pin point fried chicken locations reviewed in London. It also has iframes with more information on the sneakers featured and audio files with London musical artist in the episode. Bootstrap and jquery played a huge part in this project as well as regular html, css, and javascript.</p>
